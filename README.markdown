Barbarian
==========

Barbarian is a tool for running automated load tests. If you just want to hammer a fixed set of pages, it's probably not worth the hassle. However it may be useful if what you want to test is a sequence of actions (for example a signup process)


Agents
=======

The core unit in Barbarian is an Agent. An agent is basically a state machine hooked up to mechanize.
